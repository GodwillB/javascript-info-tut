n operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.

An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:

let x = 1;

x = -x;
alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied
