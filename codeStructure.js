// We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

// here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:

alert('Hello'); alert('World');


// statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:
alert('Hello');
alert('World');

// In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!

// There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:

alert(3 +
1
+ 2);

// Nested comments are not supported!
